JavaScript Practice
==========

Proving advanced JavaScript concepts with unit tests.

Jasmine tests are written to affirm the code snippets in various JavaScript books/resources. 

The purpose is two-fold: 
<ol>
<li>Provide an interactive way to learn. (Text books are soooo boring!!!) </li>
<li>Facilitate a deeper understanding of the JavaScript language. If you can compose an expectation and it passes, then you probably have a good grasp of the concept you are testing. If not, maybe you need to re-read. : )</li>
</ol>

#### How to install and Use

To get started quick without setting up NodeJS, go to [https://github.com/thatgirlcancode/javascript-practice](https://github.com/thatgirlcancode/javascript-practice), and download the project. There's a button the right side titled, "Download ZIP". Once downloaded to your computer, open the zip file, and find the  `SpecRunner.html file in the resources folder, and open it in your browser. This runs the tests in your browser.

If you want to run tests using NodeJS ...

Install node,  
- Mac, `brew install nodejs`  
- Linux `sudo apt-get install node`  
- Windows go to [node downloads page](http://nodejs.org/download/)  

and it's super simple,

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thatgirlcancode/javascript-practice.git
cd javascript-practice
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
npm test
```
